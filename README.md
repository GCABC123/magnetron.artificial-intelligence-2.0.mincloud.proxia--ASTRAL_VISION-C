=============================================================

This is a Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook for (for one possible scheme in) developing an ASTRAL VISION proxia when working with ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0 ™ 
(ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0 ™ is part of MAGNETRON ™ TECHNOLOGY). The machine running the Notebook will be a MINDCLOUD on which you will be
developing a PROXIA.

e.g On an ASTRAL MINDCLOUD the ASTRAL VISION PROXIA can be used to process INFORMATION sent to it from an INSTINCTIVE MIND PROXIA/MINDCLOUD (OBJECT DETECTION). So for example if the ROBOT encounters an intersting video of a dancing man on the internet or it records footage of a dancing man (with its eye cameras) it can determine the boodily configuration to mimic the human.

NOTE: DATA FROM KING CROWN TECHNOLOGY ™ ALSO AFFECTS/CONTRIBUTES TO THE OVERALL ASTRAL VISION.  KING CROWN TECHNOLOGY ™ IS NOT FOR ANALYZING DIGITAL IMAGES BUT FOR THE ANALYZING THE REAL WORLD.
